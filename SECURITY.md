## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Kafkasder Panel, please report it by emailing the project maintainers. **Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Known Security Issues

### Current Status (as of 2025-01-17)

**Total Vulnerabilities:** 6 high severity

### Active Vulnerabilities

#### 1. ⚠️ xlsx Package - Prototype Pollution & ReDoS

**Status:** ❌ **NO FIX AVAILABLE**

**Severity:** High

**CVEs:**
- [GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6) - Prototype Pollution in SheetJS
- [GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9) - Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

**Impact:**
- Used for Excel file export functionality
- Potential for prototype pollution attacks
- ReDoS vulnerability in cell range parsing

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user input before Excel export
2. **File Size Limits:** Enforce maximum file size (10MB) to prevent ReDoS
3. **Trusted Sources Only:** Only export data from trusted database sources
4. **Alternative Being Evaluated:** Consider migrating to `@sheet/core` or `exceljs`

**Usage Locations:**
- `src/lib/utils/pdf-export.ts`
- `src/lib/export/export-service.ts`
- Donation/Beneficiary export features

**Risk Assessment:** **MEDIUM**
- Exploitation requires authenticated admin access
- Export functionality is server-side only (not exposed to unauthenticated users)
- Data source is internal database (not user-provided files)

#### 2. ⚠️ whatsapp-web.js Dependencies - tar-fs & ws

**Status:** ⏸️ **FIX REQUIRES BREAKING CHANGE**

**Severity:** High (3 CVEs for tar-fs, 1 CVE for ws)

**CVEs:**
- tar-fs:
  - [GHSA-vj76-c3g6-qr5v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vj76-c3g6-qr5v) - Symlink validation bypass
  - [GHSA-8cj5-5rvv-wf4v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8cj5-5rvv-wf4v) - Path traversal via extraction
  - [GHSA-pq67-2wwv-3xjx](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pq67-2wwv-3xjx) - Link following vulnerability
- ws:
  - [GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q) - DoS via many HTTP headers

**Impact:**
- Dependencies of puppeteer (used by whatsapp-web.js)
- Not directly exploitable in current usage pattern

**Available Fix:**
- Downgrade whatsapp-web.js to v1.23.0 (breaking change)
- Current: v1.26.0
- Breaking changes need to be tested

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Network Isolation:** WhatsApp client runs in isolated process
2. **No User Input:** WhatsApp service doesn't process user-uploaded tar files
3. **Server-Side Only:** WhatsApp functionality is not exposed to client-side
4. **Rate Limiting:** WhatsApp message sending is rate-limited
5. **Scheduled Update:** Plan breaking change update in next minor release

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW**
- Requires server-side access to exploit
- tar-fs vulnerabilities require malicious tarball upload (not applicable)
- ws DoS requires direct access to WhatsApp websocket (internal only)
- WhatsApp service is optional and can be disabled

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
3. **Run `npm audit`** before every release
4. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
5. **Review security patches** before deploying

### For Deployment

1. **Use strong secrets** (min 32 characters) for CSRF_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET
2. **Enable rate limiting** on all public endpoints
3. **Configure HTTPS** in production
4. **Set up Sentry** for error monitoring
5. **Regular backups** of Convex database

### Input Validation

- All user input is validated using Zod schemas
- DOMPurify used for HTML sanitization
- CSRF protection enabled on all mutation endpoints
- Rate limiting configured per endpoint type

## Audit History

| Date | Total Vulnerabilities | Critical | High | Moderate | Low |
|------|----------------------|----------|------|----------|-----|
| 2025-01-17 | 6 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| Before cleanup | 17 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 0 |

**Recent Actions:**
- ✅ Removed unused jest dependency (eliminated 10 vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Fixed js-yaml prototype pollution (moderate)
- ⏸️ xlsx vulnerabilities documented (no fix available)
- ⏸️ whatsapp-web.js dependencies (breaking change required)

**Improvement:** 64.7% reduction (17 → 6 vulnerabilities)

## Response Plan

### High/Critical Vulnerabilities

1. Assess impact on production
2. Test available fixes in development
3. Deploy fix within 48 hours if possible
4. Document if no fix available

### Moderate Vulnerabilities

1. Review and plan fix
2. Include in next regular release
3. Apply workarounds if needed

### Dependencies Without Fixes

1. Document in this file
2. Implement mitigation strategies
3. Evaluate alternative packages
4. Set up monitoring for new fixes
